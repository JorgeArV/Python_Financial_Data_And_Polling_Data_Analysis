## Financial Data Analysis (PyBank)

![Screenshot](Images/Screenshot.jpg)
I have created a python script that analyzes financial data records to calculate the following: 

  * The total number of months included in the dataset.

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

## Polling Data Analysis (PyPoll)

I have created a python script that analyses votes in a polling data set to calculate the following:

  * The total number of votes cast.

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes.

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won.

  * The total number of votes each candidate won.

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
